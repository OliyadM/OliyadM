# Hi there 👋, I'm Oliyad Mulugeta

I'm a Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, currently focused on backend development and AI-driven projects. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean code, collaboration, and continuous learning.

🚀 I'm part of **A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley)**, where I actively engage in solving algorithmic problems and building impactful software products.

🧠 I've solved **200+ LeetCode problems**, sharpening my problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms skills through daily practice.

🎯 I'm currently An Intern at **Adot**, a maternity and pregnancy tracking startup under A2SV’s incubator, contributing to backend development.

🤖 I’m also working on AI-related projects, applying machine learning to solve real-world problems.

📱 Currently learning Flutter to build cross-platform mobile applications.
